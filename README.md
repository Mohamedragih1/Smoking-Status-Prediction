# Smoking status prediction using bio-signals 

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for our Machine Learning Assignment 3 at Alexandria University. The assignment aimed to predict an individual's smoking status using bio-signals through comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, implementation of ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning, and creating a final machine learning system.

## Assignment Highlights

### Data Analysis
- Explored and analyzed at least 20 features related to smoking status prediction.
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to gain insights into feature distributions and relationships.
- Visualized key findings for better understanding.

### Feature Engineering
- Leveraged insights from the data analyses to transform raw data into meaningful representations.
- Explored feature impacts through hands-on exercises, including normalization and outlier removal.
- Organized exploratory and explanatory analyses in separate notebooks.

### Ensemble Methods
- Implemented three ensemble methods: Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forests.
- Utilized enhanced features and models from Feature Engineering to enhance predictive accuracy.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Applied hyperparameter tuning techniques using Grid Search and Randomized Search.
- Explored optimal settings for enhanced model performance.

### Final System
- Integrated all analyses, ensemble methods, and fine-tuning to create a final machine learning system.
- Achieved the best performance based on the experimentation with various techniques.
